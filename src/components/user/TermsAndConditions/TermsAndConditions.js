                <p>(a) Service providers. Sometimes, we need to use third party Service Providers in order to provide and support the features of our Services.

We will tell you we are working with a Service Provider whenever reasonably possible, and you may request at any time the names of our Service Providers. Just like with the other third parties we work with, these third party Service Providers enter into a contract that requires them to use your Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this policy. <br /> <br />

We may partner with third parties to display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites and may share Personal Information with them for this purpose.

Participation in our Promotions is completely voluntary. Information requested for entry may include personal contact information such as your name, address, date of birth, phone number, email address, username, and similar details.

                <h2>11. Content of Marketing Campaigns</h2>
                <p>When you create and run a marketing campaign, it goes to various servers and platforms across the Internet. Along the way, server administrators and users of platforms can read what you put in the campaign. Please do not use Khozinfo to send confidential information. Sometimes we review the content of our Members’ marketing campaigns to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use. Our employees or independent contractors may review those particular marketing campaigns. This benefits all Members who comply with our Terms of Use because it reduces the number of spam accounts and our servers maintain high deliverability.</p>
                <h2>12. Your Audience Lists</h2>
                <p>A Audience List can be created in a number of ways, including by importing contacts, such as through csv, directly from your social profile or by creating an audience using our services. Your Audience Lists are stored on a secure Khozinfo server. There are two kinds of Audience lists : Public and Private. We do not, under any circumstances, sell your Private Audience Lists. If someone on your Audience List complains or contacts us, we might then contact that person. Only authorized employees have access to view Audience Lists.
                
                We will use and disclose the information in your Audience Lists only for the reasons discussed in Sections 6-9. We will not use and disclose the information in your Audience Lists to:
                
                a. bill or collect money owed to us;
                
                b. send you system alert messages;
                c. communicate with you about your account; or

                <h2>13. Notice of Breach of Security</h2>
                <p>If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you or people on your Distribution Lists, then Khozinfo will notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in response.</p>
                <h2>14. Safeguarding Your Information</h2>
                <p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.
                
                Our online wallet processing vendor uses security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us at support@khozinfo.com
                
Khozinfo accounts require a facebook account to manage or display Facebook informations. You must keep your Facebook username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Because the information in your Audience Lists is so sensitive, we rely on FB’s security checks for access, which means we cannot see your passwords / or account information on Facebook. We cannot resend or reset forgotten Facebook passwords either.</p>
                <h1>COMPLIANCE</h1>
                <h2>15. We Operate around the world</h2>
                <p>Our servers are located in cloud (Microsoft Window Web Services) so the data may go to any physical location where Microsoft Window has a Data Center. Our offices are located in Nepal, so your information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in Nepal and in any location where Microsoft Window Web Services stores its data. By using our Websites, you understand and consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information to our facilities worldwide and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this policy.</p>
                <h2>16. Accuracy of Data, Transparency, and Choice</h2>
                <p>We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do so. If your data changes (for example, if you have a new email address), then you are responsible for notifying us of those changes. Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your Personal Information.
                
                We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as long as needed to provide you with our Services. We may also retain and use your information in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our Agreements.
                
                As explained in Sections 6 and 9 of this policy, Khozinfo shares your Personal Information and the Personal Information you may have collected from your Customers with Service Providers in order to provide and support our Services. With respect to Personal Information we share with our advertising partners, you have a choice.
                
17. Access</p>
                <h2>17. Access</h2>
                <p>We will give an individual, either you or a Customer, access to any Personal Information we hold about them within 30 days of any request for that information. Individuals may request to access, correct, amend or delete information we hold about them by contacting us here. Unless it is prohibited by law, we will remove any Personal Information about an individual, either you or a Customer, from our servers at your or their request.
